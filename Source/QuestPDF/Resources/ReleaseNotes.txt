Version 2024.3.0-alpha
The primary theme of this release is the removal of the SkiaSharp dependency and the introduction of custom native layer built on top of Skia M121.
This change was necessary to provide much higher flexibility and enable several new long-awaited features:
- Font subsetting - this feature includes only necessary font glyphs in the output document, reducing the file size. The size difference can be enormous when complex fonts are used of various styles,
- Improved text-related capabilities, including text justification, bi-directionality, enhanced line breaking algorithms, and more,
- Introduced additional document compression to reduce file size,
- Integrated native SVG support,
- Improved performance by 25% on average,
- In the future release: enhanced accessibility by support for PDF tags.

We would like to thank the SkiaSharp project, its maintainers and contributors, for creating a fantastic graphics library. It was a fantastic foundation for QuestPDF for over 3 years. 

This release requires at least .NET Standard 2.1. The beta release will reintroduce support for the .NET Standard 2.0.
